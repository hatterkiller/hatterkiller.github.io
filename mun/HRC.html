                    <p>Hi!! My name is Rebecca Persson and I am currently a senior at Taipei American School. I started participating in MUN in seventh grade, and since then I have attended approximately 10 conferences as a delegate in Taiwan and abroad. As part of my MUN experience, I have had the incredible opportunity to travel to Berlin (BERMUN), Singapore (NTUMUN), Kuala Lumpur (IASAS and MYMUN) and New Haven (YMUN). This past year, I served as the Assistant Secretary General of Conference for the inaugural Yale Model United Nations conference held in Taipei, and also traveled to New Haven to participate in YMUN as a member of the World Economic Forum. I also served as the Deputy-Secretary General for TASMUN, an annual junior level conference at TAS hosted for middle school delegates.</p>
                    <p>Outside of MUN I am also an IASAS Extemporaneous Speaker, an avid foodie in love with waffles, and someone with an ever-increasing love for warm weather and traveling. My favorite city in the world would probably be a tie between Stockholm (I’m half Swedish) and Amsterdam (minus the scary bikers). I also have a love for skiing in miserably cold weather, and am obsessed with cinnamon buns.</p>
                    <p>I am super excited to be chairing for the Human Rights Committee (especially since I was a delegate in HRC last year) and look forward to meeting you all very soon! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

                    <p>As a senior at the International School of Kuala Lumpur, I have been fortunate enough to have experienced countless opportunities ever since moving to Malaysia when I was 10 years of age. Numerous doors have been opened for me in terms of extracurricular opportunities, from Student Council to NHS to Kids for Kids and more. While I cherish the many opportunities I have had, working within my school’s MUN program since I was 12 years old has left an indelible mark. Facing and exploring conflicts facing our world, rather than simply shying away from them and escaping into a comfortable state of ignorance and unawareness, has forced me to grow into a ‘global citizen’ of sorts who recognizes maintaining knowledge and understandings of events outside of the limits of what directly affects my life in the short term.</p>
                    <p>Model UN has opened my eyes to the importance of recognizing a problem, and thinking of a critical solution that takes into account as many factors as possible. Being limited to viewing issues from the perspective of single governments has forced me time and time again to challenge my own beliefs and question ideologies I have always accepted. Within IASAS MUN, I have been fortunate enough to have experience both as a delegate and as a chair. This year, once again taking on the role of a co-chair, I aim to help lead and facilitate constructive and thoughtful debate within the committee. With this being my final year in MUN, I hope to see delegates step things up and come to the table with plausible and strong resolutions, a passionate attitude, and a firm willingness to participate and accurately represent their assigned delegation.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">The question of incentives relating to organ donations</h3>
                    <p>Organ donation can be defined as the process of surgically removing an organ or tissue from one person (the organ donor) and placing it into another person (the recipient). Incentives can be defined as a thing that motivates or encourages someone to do something. Currently, as medicine has progressed rapidly over the course of the last decade, the ability for transplantation has grown. Unfortunately, the gap between the transplants needed and the organs available has also grown. In the united states alone, another name is added to the national transplant waiting list every 12 minutes and approximately 18 people die every day from the lack of available organs for transplant.</p>
                    <p>While no one denies that the supply and demand of organs fail to match up, the international community has to reconcile the need to fill the shortage with the ethical implications of incentivizing organ donation. A great issue arises when there is a lack of any incentives for organ donation, with entire reliance on deceased organ donors, those who are relatives/friends, and the few altruistic members of society that voluntarily donate to help fellow man. This policy does nothing to close the gap between donors and those in need. As a result, a black market for organ donations opens up, leading to organ trafficking, crime, and an unregulated transplant market. Each delegate needs to find means, according to their nation’s policies, of combating these issues. Often times, the rich in more economically developed nations exploit the availability of organs in those nations who are less economically developed, leading to an organ supply imbalance between nations. Outside of shortages and black markets, delegates need to account for the detrimental effects of strong incentives to the poor - such as desperation and extreme poverty leading to donations. It will be important for the delegates to carefully analyze their assigned government’s/ngo’s policies concerning the ethics of organ donations and the motivation to limit the power of organ black markets.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">The question of bridal rights in Asia</h3>
                    <p>It could be said that over the past few months feminism and the pursuit of equality between the sexes has been reinvigorated through the power of social media. Women’s rights, ranging from equal pay to reproductive rights, have gained massive exposure. This topic, bridal rights in Asia, deals with a more marginalized issue that lacks the international ubiquity that tends to attract powerful media attention. Bridal rights, by definition, are the inalienable entitlements a female holds in a circumstance of marriage.</p>
                    <p>In writing resolutions, there are various perspectives open to be taken. There are two distinctive sides to this topic: nations in support of expanding and strengthening bridal rights and those against. Keep in mind that each delegate is meant to put forth the perspectives of the governments themselves, not necessarily the potentially progressive view of the majority of women and men within the nation. Delegates should address the question of general rights women’s rights in relation to marriage, such as the right to decide whom to marry, property rights, custody rights, protection against domestic violence, and divorce rights. Solutions should range from international reform and regulation of minimum standards of women’s rights in general, to developmental programs such as publicity campaigns and education programs to promote female equality and progress. Additionally, particularly in Asia, the issue of where the line is to be drawn in terms of cultural and religious sensitivity and unassailable human rights needs to be addressed.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">The question of Violations of Prisoner’s Freedoms</h3>
                    <p>The issue of violations of prisoner’s freedoms is not a topic often at the forefront of media attention, despite its common and persistent occurrence. The expectation is that all governments and judicial systems should actively ensure that jails, prisons, and detention centers comply with their respective constitutions and legal frameworks, domestic law, and widely accepted international human rights norms. However, reality often falls short of this expectation.</p>
                    <p>Prisoners worldwide face inhumane, degrading and cruel conditions of confinement, infringing upon their inherent rights and freedoms. Their ability to freely practice their own religion and expression is often neglected, and so is their freedom to have access to a fair and unbiased judicial system with adequate legal support. Prisoner’s freedoms are often infringed upon in the prison setting and during the judicial process out of conscious choice, and occasionally out of negligence.</p>
                    <p>The solution to violations of prisoner’s freedoms will have to include the issue of accountability, and the extent to which proposals can be monitored and enforced on a regional, or local level. This may require the use of certain incentives as a motivator for countries to reform and reassess their current treatment of prisoners. Proposals will also have to account for the fact that laws and regulations governing prisoner’s freedoms and rights are not universal in nature, and that some discrepancy and deviation does exist. Thus, proposals would have to account for the relative nature of certain laws.</p>
                    <p>Prisoner’s freedoms must also be viewed in the context of war. Laws that govern the treatment and freedoms of prisoners are often directly violated during conflict and warfare. Thus, proposals will have to account for the fact that war zones are often the setting where the gravest violations of prisoner’s freedoms occur. Resolutions will also have to address the fact that warzones are difficult to monitor, and that any proposal passed would need to be something realistically enforceable in such an environment.</p>
                    <p>Some useful resources to explore in the process of research include the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (1955) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners is an established set of guidelines outlining standards of hygiene, clothing, medical services, discipline, religion, cultural practices, and expression that governments should adhere to. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights outlines the fundamental principles that govern the incarcerated, and reinforces the fact that they withhold innate freedoms and liberties that cannot be taken away. I would also recommend perusing the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of Punishment which sets forth another set of expectations on prisoner’s rights.</p>
