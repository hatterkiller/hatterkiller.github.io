                    <p>Dear delegates, Chairs and faculty advisors,</p>
                    <p>I am absolutely thrilled to welcome you to the 2014 IASAS MUN Conference at the Jakarta International School!</p>
                    <p>It is my hope that this year’s IASAS Conference will provide delegates with an opportunity to engage in rewarding debate. We have selected an assortment of relevant - and in some cases dire - issues, enabling delegates to dice with some of the many delicate problems society faces today.</p>
                    <p>In the spirit of novelty, it is with anticipation that we introduce the new Historical Committee. This creation allows for the exploration of many historical issues that would otherwise never be touched upon in MUN. Perhaps for once, the past will not repeat itself.</p>
                    <p>A bit about myself - though a bit of a latecomer to MUN, I quickly developed a vehement love for the podium and a borderline unhealthy fixation on current events upon joining the club. The intense debate, witty (and occasionally acid) exchanges, and incredible people are part of why I relish the activity, not to mention the opportunities to tackle some very real issues society faces and enhance your public speaking skills. But I need not go further - you undoubtedly already know all this and share my passion for MUN, that’s why you’re here!</p>
                    <p>Aside from an MUNer I’m also a cooking fanatic, scuba diving enthusiast and classical guitar player. I abhor cheese, love fruits, and have a (slightly) dark and sarcastic sense of humor. </p>
                    <p>It’s my absolute honor to serve as Secretary General for this conference, and I am very excited to meet you all. A great effort has been made to maintain the excellent standing of IASAS conferences, and I am certain that debate this year will be as outstanding as always. Whether you’re new to MUN, an old-timer, Chair, or coach, I wish you the best of luck and hope you have a wonderful time at IASAS!</p>

                    <p>Hello everyone. My name is Toby, and I’m a junior at International School Bangkok. I am American-Thai, but I have been fortunate enough to live in both Tokyo and Singapore aside from Bangkok. I’ve been in MUN since freshmen year, starting at the American School in Japan. I initially joined MUN because of my predilection for global politics, and desire for better public speaking skills. It has since developed into my favorite school activity. Last year, I was lucky enough to be selected for the IASAS conference in Kuala Lumpur, serving as the delegate of Bolivia in SPECPOL. Outside of IASAS, I have participated in various MUN conferences around Asia, serving as both a delegate, and as a chair. This is all on top of weekly MUN debates at ISB. MUN has made me laugh, cry, and feel an extensive range of emotions. From watching the Taliban, FARC, Hezbollah, the Syrian Opposition and others participate in SPECPOL last year, to making new friends and meeting incredible people, there are many MUN experiences that are simply unforgettable. MUN has played a critical role in my high school life thus far. It has changed my perception of the world, and it has molded me into an engaged, global citizen.</p>
                    <p>I am currently part of the International Baccalaureate program at ISB, of which I am enjoying greatly! My academic interests include Economics, which I intend to study at university. When I am not MUNing at school, I am an active member of several community service clubs and Amnesty International.  In my free time I enjoy reading, keeping up with American politics, sleeping for extended periods of time, and watching lots of film. My favorite directors include Stanley Kubrick, and Wong Kar-Wai.</p>
                    <p>I am very excited to serve as the Deputy Secretary General this year. Please feel free to ask me any questions, or raise any concerns you may have throughout the duration of the conference. I look forward to working with every single one of you in Jakarta this November.</p>

                    <p>It is my upmost pleasure to welcome all of you to IASAS MUN 2014, hosted by JIS! We’ve been working hard over the past few months to prepare this conference for you, and hope the hand-picked issues and exciting new committee (got goosebumps yet Historical Committee delegates?) are all prepared for great debate!</p>
                    <p>As for a little bit about myself, I got involved in MUN relatively late, but after attending BEIMUN in sophomore year as Tunisia, and IASAS at ISKL as Hezbollah last year I’ve witnessed debates on copious resolutions, and love the sass and attitude in particular that comes along with being a delegate. Embracing ones’ delegation is an extremely important part of being a delegate, even if representing their views may often collide with your own. In fact, on that note, I’d like to remind all that Hezbollah is most definitely NOT a terrorist group.</p>
                    <p>My other interests are rather eclectic. Service is a huge part of my life, and I have consequently been involved with GIN since 8th grade ( looking forward to perhaps meeting a few fellow Ginners at IASAS). Another passion of mine is Bollywood Dance, which I have been doing since I was only 4, and am at the moment teaching to prepare for our annual UN day!</p>
                    <p>It is my greatest honor to be your Parliamentarian this year, and I can assure you this year’s conference will be one to remember. First time delegates, old delegates, and chairs as well: I strongly advise you to take in the atmosphere and cherish this opportunity, as in these 3 days, it is indescribable how much one can learn and grow, both in the strength of ones’ speeches and debate, but more importantly, as citizens of the world.</p>
                    <p>I hope you are as excited as I am, and  look forward to meeting as well as working with all of you. Good luck in your preparation delegates and chair- see you soon.</p>
