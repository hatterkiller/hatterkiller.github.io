Malik the SpearWalrus

Brawlhalla Legend Concept: The Walrus Hunter from the unforgiving Arctic Ice plains. 

Meet Malik, a Walrus. Inspired by Max Kostenko's Walrus drawing, Malik swam all the way to Vahalla just to find some fish to hunt.

But instead of fish, he found all these other Legends to beat up. 

Good enough. 

Malik wields a Bow and a Spear, the weapons of a true hunter.
